# Description

RIBDetector is a tool which performs inconsistency bug detection in protocol implementations. It supports the following functionality:

1. Given a series of RFC documents and a pre-written configuration file about their writing style, it can extract rules about packet format, state transition and error handling from the documents.

2. It can identify the rule-specified operations in corresponding protocol implementations and detect inconsistency bug based on the extracted rules.

Currently, RIBDetector supports detection on C/C++ protocol implementations only.

# File structure
The most important folders in RIBDetector's root directory are:

1. **'tool'**, directory containing the Python scripts for rule extraction and the LLVM pass for bug detection.

2. **'input'**, directory containing examples of configuration file and RFC documents. 

    i. **'doc/rfcxxx.txt'** contains the RFC document of network protocol. 
    
    ii. **'config/rfc_config_xx.json'**, example of configuration file describing the format of specific keywords and meta-info in BGP, EIGRP and DHCP protocols. Users can modify the file if needed.   
    
    iii. **'proc/xx.bc'**, example of  .bc file of network protocol implementations complied with LLVM.


3. **'output'**, directory containing examples of extracted rules, results of rule-specified operation identification and bug detection.

	i. **'result_of_extractor/rule-xx.json or meta-info-xx.json'**: machine readable rules/meta-info extracted from RFC documents under the input directory, which will be used as input of operation identification and bug detection.

	
    ii. **'result_of_identify/Identify_xx.json'**: key structures or their corresponding variables identified by RIBDetector in source code implementations, which will be further used to investigate rule-specified operations and detect inconsistency bugs.     
   
    iii. **'inconsistency_bug/bug_report_xx'**: inconsistency bugs reported by RIBDetector.
# How to use

To use RIBDetector, it is necessary to perform the following steps:

1. Ensure pre-requisites are met

3. Use WLLVM to compile the under-considering protocol implementation into one .bc file

4. Use RIBDetector to perform inconsistency bug detection on the file

## Ensuing pre-requisites

RIBDetector has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04. It should work on any recent Linux distribution. Support for other platform has not been tested. In a nutshell, the advised pre-requisites are:
* Ubuntu 16.04 
* Pyhton3.6, NLTK, spacy 
* LLVM 10.0, Clang 10.0
* WLLVM
* Z3 Solver 4.8.10

## Compiling Target Implementation

Before performing bug detection, one should compile the target protocol implementation with WLLVM.

```
export LLVM_COMPILER=clang
CC=wllvm CXX=wllvm++  ./configure  CFLAGS="-g -O0"
extract-bc <target_dir> 
```

## Run RIBDetector

To  perform inconsistency bug detection on the implementation, run the following command under tool directory:

```
tool/run_script.py -bc <input bitcode> -config <configure file> 
-bc                .bc file of the implementation
-config            configuration file of the Rule extractor of the protocol  

eg: tool/run_script.py -bc proc/openbgpd.bc -config config/rfc_config_bgp.json
```

## Results of RIBDetector

**Result of Rule Extraction**

Examples of rules and meta-info extraction result can be found under output/result_of_extractor directory.

e.g.`meta-info-bgp.json and rule-bgp.json`

Rule violation:
Rule: chk_bf(BGP Identifier == 0 || BGP Identifier == local BGP Identifer, set(2, 3) )
Locaton: xx.c line xx function parse_open
[ERROR] Impl Conds do not comply with RFC Conds
